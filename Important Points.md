**`Tim Sort`**: Python's default **sort()** & **sorted()** uses Tim Sort, which is a combination of both **Merge Sort** and **Insertion Sort**.
                The Time Complexity of Timsort is **O(n log n)** for the Worst Case and Average Case, and **O(n)** for the Best Case (when the input is already sorted).
